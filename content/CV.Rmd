## EDUCATION

--------------------------------------------------------

**The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX** | Expected May 2020  

|    Bachelor of Science and Arts in Neuroscience, Honors
|    Certificate in Evidence and Inquiry
|    Current GPA 3.96/4.00

## RESEARCH INTERESTS

--------------------------------------------------------

My primary interests lie in the field of neuroethology, specifically in the molecular basis of social behavior, problem-solving behaviors, and auditory communication. Broadly, my research in this area focuses on how the environment modulates social behavior in various study models. I also have an interest in the effectiveness of narrative-based science communication and the role of science entertainment in conveying pro-science values.
