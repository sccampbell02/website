---------------------------
Hello! I am an undergraduate student completing a bachelor's degree in Neuroscience from the University of Texas at Austin.

My scientific work looks at the molecular basis of social behavior in paper wasps and cichlid fish, and relates these findings to a broader evolutionary and ecological context. I'm also invested in determining how the scientific community can better reinforce trust with the public, particularly through narrative storytelling.

When I'm not doing science, you can find me field sketching, baking, or backpacking.
