<h2>RESEARCH INTERESTS</h2>
<hr />
<p>My primary interests lie in the field of neuroethology, specifically in the molecular basis of social behavior, problem-solving behaviors, and auditory communication. Broadly, my research in this area focuses on how the environment modulates social behavior in various study models. I also have an interest in the effectiveness of narrative-based science communication and the role of science entertainment in conveying pro-science values.</p>
