      <description>Nucleotide sequence alignment can be tedious to code by hand, but thanks to services like BLAST and the Python package biopython, understanding the alignment process is not necessary for producing parsimonious alignments. Even though hand-coding isn&#39;t the quickest method, understanding traditional algorithms can clear up how modern programs work and aid in troubleshooting. I&#39;ll go over a common global alignment algorithm, the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm.
Needleman-Wunsch algorithm This is a global alignment algorithm, identifying the best alignment after considering each residue within the entire sequence.</description>
